# node-restify-customers
Middleware API to manage CRUD operations about customers with Node JS.

Use of restify, which borrows heavily from express but it is lighter to build "strict" API services that are maintanable and observable.

Use of restify-server-manager to create/start/stop a restify.js server based on configuration object.
